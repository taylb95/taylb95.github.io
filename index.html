										<h2 class="major">Who are we?</h2>
										<p>Mabawa is a nonprofit organization that was created to get the village of Nyamyumba back on its feet again, after the devastation of the Rwandan Genocide. We focus on improving seven areas of the community: health, agriculture, education, water, housing, microcredit, and beekeeping. We also do our best to begin integrating pygmies into Nyamyumba.  </p>

										<h2 class="major">Travel Abroad</h2>
										<p>I discovered Mabawa through my Virginia Tech study abroad program, Creating Sustainable Social Change. I learned to open my eyes and my heart to the world and cultures around me; because of this I encourage everyone to study or travel abroadâ€”to get out of his or her comfort zone and help those whom are less fortunate. You can read more about that <a href="https://medium.com/@taylb95/mabawa-giving-wings-to-nyamyumba-rwanda-350c3a76d126#.51vjz130a/"> here.</a>   </p>

										<h2 class="major">Work Thus Far</h2>
										<p>So far, Mabawa has built multiple schools and houses, provided Nyamyumba with doctors, distributed livestock, supplied clean water, helped the people launch successful businesses, and promoted prosperity through beekeeping.

									<h2 class="major">NGO Work</h2>
									<p>NGO stands for non-governmental organization; its purpose is to raise awareness and create good change, whether it be for a disease, an area, a group of people, etc. However, it's been brought to my attention that some believe NGO's do more harm than good. While this may have been the case with some nonprofits, Mabawa is the perfect example of a successful NGO and model for other NGO's.
