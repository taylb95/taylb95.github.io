My name is Taylor Bennett. I have always dreamt of traveling, and last fall I actually left the country.

        <h2>My Project</h2>

        <p>
Most people haven't heard of it, but there is an NGO called Mabawa. Mabawa is stationed in a very small town in Rwanda, Africa. So far, they have raised enough money to build schools and water tanks, and implement curriculum that will help the children learn and succeed in life. Last fall, I spent two months creating a curriculum for the children that inhabit Nyamyumba, and then spent the following month actually teaching it. I never imagined going to Africa. It was always a far-off place that I could imagine and fantasize about. But the fact that I actually, physically was there? That's amazing. Always expect the unexpected.
